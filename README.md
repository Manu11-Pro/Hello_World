Hello World! in every Programming Language!

Programming Language/
    A programming language is a formal set of instructions, rules, and syntax that lets humans tell computers what to do, acting as a bridge to create software, apps, websites, and automate tasks by translating human-understandable code into machine-readable binary (zeros and ones). Like natural languages, each programming language (e.g., Python, JavaScript, C++) has its own vocabulary and grammar, enabling developers to build specific digital tools.
